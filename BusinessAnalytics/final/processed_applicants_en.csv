Before I was volunteering at ""Yerevan-Aleppo Transit"" club which is a special ground for Syrian Armenians and local Armenians to organize joint events together.  ","This is going to be the third Aurora Prize nomination and it's already an important fact to celebrate because it's already third year that Armenia delivers calls of dignity, humanity and gratitude to the world. Actually I applied to Aurora 2017 and even passed to interview stage but because of my tight schedule I could not participate in this kind of unique event. This year I want to catch my opportunity and I'm full of motivation to be part of Aurora devoted community. 
Things that happening in the Middle East, the Northern and central Africa, the South-Eastern Asia are really challenging for humanity and disastrous for future generations. Everyday hundreds of people are dying because of lack of peace, let's call it war, because of hate crimes, discrimination, because of starvation, lack of water. Everyday hundreds of people are facing human rights violations and they still can not do anything. This scene is so dark and gloomy but there is always light in the end of tunnel. And this light are the people who are forgetting about their personal life and devoting themselves to the profession which is called humanitarianism. They are doctors, human rights activists, soldiers, waiters, barmen, artists, actors, they have many professions but they are united around the table of humanitarianism. Hundreds of people are saved in Syria, Yemen, Palestine, Iraq, Somalia, CAR, Sudan, Burma, Pakistan and elsewhere in this world due to these people of dignity, people of honor. 
Genocide that happened to Armenians at the beginning of XX century showed that world was full of beasts who like the flavor of blood, but it also showed that there were people like Nansen, Wenger, Morgenthau, France and others in the end of dark tunnel that brought the light and saved hundred of thousands Armenians who are living and prospering never forgetting what happened to their ancestors and never forgetting where their actual homeland is.
Aurora initiative is organised by descendants of these Armenians. I do not mean only Rouben Vardanian, Noubar  Afeian, Vartan Gregorian, but also all the volunteers, supporting staff who are united for the same goal. It's time to honor all the new heroes who are putting their life under danger and save the people all over the globe. We already know Marguerite Barankitse and Thom Cateena and their fellow nominees but the amount of such people is so huge.
Now Armenia, Armenian people are very thankful to the world for saving lives of the whole nation. It's time to give back the care, the love, the enthusiasm back to world and Aurora initiative is a door to do so.
I would like to be part of such event to honor those people who are saving human lives, to honor my descendants who died during Genocide and to enrich myself with positive and motivational energy.

Though this seems like a very small step, I believe that by taking small steps, each of us can have his/her contribution to the betterment of our world and to the establishment of peace. 

In the past tho years, the nominees of Aurora Prize have inspired me to believe in a more humanitarian and loving world. As a volunteer of Aurora Prize 2018, I want to expose myself to the ideas of caring for other people and protecting their lives as our own. As a volunteer of Aurora Prize 2018, I want to become a part of the change for a more peaceful and more giving world. I want to dedicate my strengths, my knowledge and my experience in the implementation of Aurora Prize 2018, where all of us will come together to appreciate the tremendous amount of efforts that each nominee has put for a change. 

I believe that being a part of this beautiful journey, I will grow as a citizen and as a human being. At the same time, I believe that bringing my positivity and detail-oriented nature as an event organizer, I can contribute to the working team to make this project happen. 

Becoming a part of this project, I hope to make strong connections with future peace-builders, humanitarian workers and ordinary citizens who want to make a change. I hope to collaborate with them even after the weekend as a strong bond. As once Marguerite Barankitse said when we die we will only take the faces of the people who we have loved. Hence, I hope that becoming a volunteer, I will be able to gain many loved people whom I will never forget.

","I enjoy volunteering! For me volunteering is an opportunity. 

I have tried out different kinds of volunteering activities and for me each one of them is a unique experience. What is unique about Aurora volunteers’ community, is that because of its wide scope, Aurora involves volunteers from different places, universities, organizations, regions etc. I very much appreciate this diversity for me and my peers’ personal growth. It gives an opportunity to meet, talk, share and learn. Having different backgrounds we get the chance to see others perspectives and make new conclusions. 

Other than getting to know the other volunteers, Aurora gives a chance to communicate with the guests, even if it may be just a simple 5 minute question & answer. You develop further your communication means, you learn from the person’s behavior and try to be at your best as a representative of your country. These all is done through showing your respect, politeness, quick problem solving skills in a way that it might be considered a good impression made for life. 

Apart from my personal gains, there is one most important thing about being an Aurora volunteer. That is the mission of Aurora humanitarian action. It is when you realize that it’s possible that your still developing, survivor country can provide support to others, who are in bigger need. When you see that the world accepts Armenia not just as a survivor country, but rather as one, which can be a help to others and be the organizer of such an event as Aurora. It’s a huge responsibility in front of the whole world to be at our best and to show that we can make a change. And it would be my honor to have my little contribution to a project like Aurora and realize that in a bigger picture I’ve put my own efforts towards the accomplishment of this humanitarian initiative.

","Volunteering is a very important part of my life. It is not just a good experience but also a huge network of communication, new opportunities. Moreover, I enjoy volunteering, as I am lucky enough to be able to help someone or have my contribution to something important. Volunteer work makes me feel good.  You experience new environments and situations, develop new skills, are acquainted with interesting people. I think that responsibility; communication and teamwork skills are important characteristics of each volunteer. 
This particular volunteering opportunity is very important for me, as I want to become a member of this big community. There are many students coming from different universities, and it’s always interesting to understand their perspectives and make new friends As I am from Gyumri, it will also be very interesting to meet people from different regions of Armenia. This is a great chance to develop a strong network of our future. Moreover, you learn not only from every experience, but also from every person you meet. As I am interested in Guest Management, I can imagine how much I will gain from each guest. I will meet and be able to communicate with people, whom I would not be able to meet otherwise. Talking with them about Aurora, Armenia and their emotions. 
Additionally, the mission and values of Aurora are very important too. Aurora connects people, inspires, motivates and gives hope of a better world. It is my pleasure, to have my little contribution in such a massive project. I know that this experience can change my perspectives and make me think and talk about things that are very important not only for Armenia but the whole world. Aurora creates a new image of Armenia, in the whole world. People, who have never heard of this small country, discover its big heart and yearning. The world recognizes modern heroes and inspires them. This is a great step for creating a better world, by showing people, that no one in this world is alone. It destroys ignorance and spreads love and kindness. I want to be, one of the people who carry the big message of Aurora and helps to awaken humanity. It is a very big responsibility, but a big pleasure to feel that you can have an impact and contribution to this project.

Aurora Prize for awakening humanity gave us a great opportunity to know about many great-hearted people and their incredible feats of bravery. I want to get to know that unique personalities who make the planet better.
Watching ceremony I asked myself from where so much love and courage. Participants inspired me to be stronger and give much more warmth and smiles to people of our big family, we really are a big earth family: there are no nationalities, place of residence, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language or any other status.  I remember following the Aurora news, the awards ceremony, stories of the “Aurora” Prize heroes. I remember being very impressed and inspired by all participants as they have sacrificed their lives for the sake of helping others live. History has proven that although horrific events occur and still exist, kindness and humanity will always prevail the atrocities.
Now it seems the greatest thing to keep Humanity awakening, like “Aurora” does, and finding one’s mission in humanitarian activities. And I really want to be a part of this wonderful ceremony. I know that some very important and admirable work was being done by the volunteers at the 100 LIVES project last year and I want to be one of them this year.

 I was born in Poland and lived in Armenia for a long time which means I have friends on in both countries and I am familiar with European and Caucasian lifestyle, tastes and ways of living and people with different backgrounds. Long story short, I this can be a perfect opportunity to me to feel the both sides, and see their working together for a high reason.
Everything we do can be delivered to a lot of enthusiasts so that more and more people can join us! As a well known saying says ideas are good, but only when you find ways to realise them!

I was an active member in social activies in our region. I organized lots of meetings with school children of Vayq. We discussed the main issues in our community and tried to find ways of solving them. Therefore, we did clean ups around Vayq and Yeghegnadzor, volunteered in public library and promoted the activity of the youth in social life. Besides, I also was a member in ""I am the community"" camp organized by UNDP. During that program I not only developed leadership skills, but also interviewed inhabitants of Jermuk. They told us about the most important problems of their villages and we offered various ways to get rid of them or found appropriate solutions.  I also had a chance to have meetings with very prominent people, such as UN's representative of Armenia, Coca Cola's representative of Armenia and so on. That is why I think I have good communication and volunteering skills.","
 For me volunteering is a chance to recognize myself. As I always try to discover myself from another side, I start meeting new people, look for adventures and new programs which may help me develop both my personality and intelligence.  When getting to know different people, different types of personalities and mentalities, we broaden our horizons. A project like Aurora gives an opportunity to meet, talk, share and learn. Therefore, one can also develop communication means, because as far as I know, volunteers get a chance to speak to the guests, too.  
 Moreover, our perspectives and behaviour to this or that question will completely change. By meeting absolutely diverse people, including other volunteers and guests, we may change the way we think and act. I think that this kind of experience will be full of challenges and coping with hardships is one of my favorite things.
 We all know how small our country is. It struggled a lot and always had to overcome difficulties. However, it did not disturb us to be kind and spread kindness worldwide. I am so much eager to be a part of Aurora's big family, because I can have my little contribution to such a humankind work. Even though, our nationality is scattered all around the world and only few people live here in Armenia,  Aurora is a proof that one does not need to have a lot of money or does not need to be very big to make changes or to create something new. Hundreds of people help others, create favorable places for the poor to live peacefully and calm, but only few people see and appreciate that generosity. I am proud that our country organized such an event which can make others see the invisible.

Volunteering teaches you more than anything else does: it makes you responsible, creative, friendly, opens your eyes on many life scenes and it makes you a modern thinking international person. I have got to improvise many times, got shocked, pressured, but that post-feeling, that makes you realize you have done the job and it was done in a best way it could, does give you the confidence and the right to be proud of yourself. For sure not everyone, maybe no-one ever tried themselves in volunteering can imagine and accept the fact that more than 50 percent of a job was done by young volunteers seeking for some practice and appreciation.

","Aurora connects all the people around the world to a humanitarian purpose. It will be fascinating for me to be a part of the event. I believe, my experience in participating in international events will help me to make the event even better. Moreover, the weekend will give me invaluable volunteering experience, many friends and interesting connections, memories and a PURPOSE.
Being a young volunteer in this humanitarian process will help me to be a better Armenian, a better citizen of the world.
Also, most importantly, I will have the feeling that I have somehow contributed to the Aurora Prize weekend and have been a part of this massive international humanitarian event.
From the very early childhood, I wanted to become an economist, a writer, an artist, an architect, and so on. However, there is one thing that I wanted to do despite all of these varieties: I wanted to be a good person for Armenia and make Armenia proud of me.
Currently, I am a PR student who is interested in political science, volunteering, international relations. I still have the dream to represent my country with dignity.
It has been several years since I annually watch Aurora Prize and understand the great impact the organizers have not only on Armenia and its prosperous future but also on the world's better future. Influenced by the Aurora Prize, I not only want to be a good Armenian but also a good citizen of the world (in fact, these facts are interconnected).

I believe the volunteers need to feel the huge responsibility and value the trust placed on them. So, they should invest their skills and abilities into the event and be passionate about what they are doing. I think I was one of those volunteers last year and I am ready to be one of them during 2018 Aurora Prize weekend. 
Volunteering plays crucial role in my life as I have acquired great amount of knowledge and skills, valuable network and friendships due to it. I consider the development of the culture of volunteerism to be essential for the Armenian society. To have my input in the creation and development of that culture, I became an active Executive Board member of AUA Volunteers’ League student organization, which cooperates with many host organizations providing volunteering opportunities for AUA students. Now I am the Operations Manager of the student organization and I have coordinated about 30 volunteering opportunities, organized and coordinated different events, conferences, and festivals.

I am happy that my English skills became a great help.

	◦	In 2017 I was awarded with a certificate of gratitude by Yerevan Municipality for displaying social activity in the framework of three-year entertainment-event program “Yerevan TARAZfest”. My reponsibilities were interviewing people and advertising the event. It was very important for me as I was introducing Yerevan as a unique community and Armenian culture in general with its traditions and customs to the guests of our city.
	◦	I volunteered to My Armenia program to organize Myhandamde armenia Artisans festival held on Sep 29-30,2017 supported by USAID, Smithsonian Institution. I was monitoring different regional groups demonstrating and selling their handmade products during the festival. I am happy to say that I learned about of new things about my motherland and skills how to introduce my country abroad. I am also happy that this festival was an opportunity to people from regions to show their talents.
	◦	Last year I researched a subject about cultural diversity at my previous school. I chose specifically this subject because nowadays it is a subject of matter and world issue. Actually, I am for cultural diverse and my aim was to understand what my fellow citizens think about, besides I interviewed many people from abroad and then I made statistics what people think today. It was very helpful for me because I understand that I should live in the way to make people understand the equality of everybody.
	◦	I went to summer camp in 2014, which was my one of the best experience in my life. British Council camp taught me full of skills and after I understood that I grew. The title was that we were all “Futurechangemakers” and that was a true because currently we pass into serious life and we are ones who will make changes and developments.The aim of that camp was not only English lessons but also show teenagers how to teambuild or how to create their own community and keep in touch with different people with different ages. 
	◦	Two years ago my previous school organized clean up activity with the support of Yerevan Municipality. When I got to know that I will be a little of help for my city I was insipred with that idea. That volunteer work gave me positive emotions and I understood how I like doing such things for my city. Previously, I never thought that I could be a little help for my city purity. 
	◦	I volunteered in “Color Foam Party 2017” festival which was organized my the youth. I wanted to colunteer there because I support the fact that open-minded people give opportunities to youth to have festival and just spend some time together. There I was PR Marketer and our team gathered approximately 70-90 people which was our goal. I learned new skills from there and understood that I have little skills to market my product.
	◦	I was a member of “Dilijan Music Fest 2017” team. That fest was unique with that idea because we all organized that fest with all our ideas. That was a real teamwork and we achieve our goals there. Our product was that festival and we worked on our product very much that collect many customers. I was PR marketer, besides, during that festival I was selling some food and coffee. That was a great day because I was happy with my work and I had a great time with the result of our team and me.
	◦	Currently, I am a volunteer at Cafesjian library, helping with library staff and also participating in their organized events.","

In short I enjoy doing volunteering that is the best way to develop yourself, make a good networking and just feel good.)","I applied 2 years ago for being a volunteer but didn't succeed in application.To be honest I have heart a lot about the event and have friends that previously volunteered, thus I am very curious about being a part of the event myself and about the volunteering process.  I think now I am more experienced and  will show my contribution to one of the greatest project in Armenia better.As you may see I am quite informed about ongoing processes in the world and that comes from not  only due to my profession but also the practical experiences and devotion to the work  I have had. The project will  give an opportunity to meet special guest,I will do my best to guide and coordinate them properly as I have  communicative skills and responsibility to my work.

Being successful is not an achievement, making a significance, is the goal I think everyone should set upon himself. Many people in our countries end up with jobs and later with some money in bank accounts, but most of them do not even like what they do. However, at the end of the day, all of us should think whether or not our lives impacted someone else’s. Aurora Prize is one of the greatest opportunities to meet inspirational people who have already made significance in so many people lives. To people, who do not have opportunities as we all do to everyday supplies, who have dreams, most of which we just take as granted. I have had an opportunity to be a delegate and an organizer at many forums all over the Europe and the US, meet many people with various backgrounds and I understood one thing, the humanity is the most important value. And the Aurora Prize ensures that the real heroes of our time who devoted their lives to keep an act of humanity alive, are being appreciated. Being chosen to be a small part of the Aurora Prize weekend would be an absolute honor for me and during which I would not only meet inspirational people who constantly ensure that people no matter of their backgrounds would still believe that their dreams are valid, but also I would develop as a person who would better understand how to give back to the society. I would do my best to ensure the absolute success of the event.","Tatev Revival project, Dilijan Development project, Artsakh Development project, Dilijan Art Initiative",EYP Armenia,Word of mouth,,eng,hovhannisyannelli2@gmail.com,False

Firstly, I want to mention the fact that I have already had some experiences connected to the organization of the events. Some of the examples are in the above-mentioned list. Through doing community service, I realized that I can really get myself lure into it and get my maximum input in doing a specific work. This helps me succeed and get involved in them more and more every year.
Secondly, I can surely say that I adore this event for the reason that I am interested in global politics, history and human rights in general. I, very often, spend most of my time reading different articles and books to enhance my scope of understanding about the world. As I read them, I feel myself as a global citizen who is upset about the global problems no matter in which country they are. 
Moreover, since I got nominated to continue my education in UWC Pearson college this year, I realized that I should be well-informed about the global problems and contribute my knowledge or support to solve some of them. Even if I had already been interested in them and had already started new initiatives in my community, I also accepted the fact that now I am much more responsible for enlarging the borders of my community service to the bigger and in the global areas such as having an opportunity to do volunteering in 2018 Aurora Prize weekend. My input in this program will be getting information from you and from the participants of this great event and sharing my knowledge and support as much as I can.
I truly believe that I can be addition to this event and that will benefit both myself and others.

First of all, the idea behind the 100 Lives project and Aurora Prize are very close to me and my way of thinking. I do share similar views on the subject of humanity and believe that we should support humanitarian projects around the world. This way we show our gratitude to those people and organizations that have the courage and commitment to bring difference and make an impact in lives of other people, who need help. Likewise, I truly appreciate having an opportunity to express my gratitude to such people and do something worthwhile in return by volunteering during the Aurora Prize ceremony. This is truly one of the most unique events in Armenia, and I really want to help make this event memorable and impactful for the guests, local community and the world. I believe that the experience and skills that I obtained while volunteering at Aurora Prize as well as other events will become handy and help me to fully carry out my work during the ceremony. Furthermore, volunteering at this event will be a great way to meet new people and gain new experiences. I am eager to meet other volunteers, who also enjoy helping the community and share similar interests. I believe this is a great space for us to exchange our knowledge and ideas in order to help with the organization of the ceremony in the best way possible. Additionally, working with so many different people will help me further enhance my interpersonal and organizational skills.

I volunteered at Armenian Red Cross from March 2017 to June 2017 where I was tutoring for students who needed help to have success in their education. During a project called Aybapatum held by Ayb School, I travelled to Berkaber, a border village, and tutored Armenian History at the local school. I was also a logistical supporter during an event held by Tedx Kids Yerevan. I was an editor in Wikipedia, where I translated many articles from English to Armenian, although I am not very much an active editor currently because of an overloaded schedule. I am also volunteering at my school: my activities involve a wide range of areas, from physical work to translations of video and text materials from English to Armenian.","In my opinion Aurora Humanitarian Initiative is one of the most valuable and most creative ideas in the history of the humanity. It not only encourages people to love their sisters and brothers and make the world a better place, but also calls for the attention of the international community to one of the cruelest and most ruthless crimes in the history of mankind, the Armenian Genocide. I have been following the ceremony since 2015, the year it began, and have been inspired by it. My interest in the initiative rose when Ruben Vardanian, one of the visionaries of Aurora, was invited to my school to have an interview with students and respond to their questions. I was inspired by his ideas and visions.

This hereby I would like to state my interest in volunteering at Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity. I perceive the very program as an outstanding example
of philanthropy  contributing and assisting  the development of some vulnerable communities and  those at  risk. 
Having completed Bachelor's program in Linguistics and currently working as an administrative assistant at ""Vatche and Tamar Manoukian"" Manuscript Depository, where my responsibilities also include translation and tour guiding, I have excellent written/oral communication and presentation skills in English.
Additionally, having two years' of experience as a board member in a youth-oriented non-governmental organization called ""Civil Consciousness"", it has primarily shaped my understanding of core working principles of NGOs, enabled with organizational skills (presentations, meetings, round tables), enlarged my horizons to make a difference as an individual and as a citizen with civil consciousness. Thus, in this respect, the training course is of special interest to me, since the well-being of humankind mostly depends on a solution of social and global problems.
What refers to my personal skills, I am very flexible, creative and responsive with high sense of responsibility. My passion for hardworking, strive for perfection, sufficient management skills will be excellent for the program. 
Thus, taking into account my educational and professional skills, I am pretty sure that together with  the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative I shall be able to develop new ideas, outgrow professionally, share and use the experience gained through the program and find new ways to fight against illiteracy, unemployment, poverty, sanitation, etc.
I would appreciate a personal interview to discuss the ways in which my experience and background can assist you to attain your goals. Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,

","Three is always a lucky number. Everyone always said they would definitely third time. Well, I decided to try a third time, ""Aurora"" award voluntarily.
Once you become a volunteer and then you realize how interesting and important work you are doing a warm and begin to deal with it constantly. Volunteering has always given me new skills, confidence, friends, consciousness and experience. I am convinced that the ""Aurora"" Awards will be no exception. This is a platform where I can use my skills, learn new ones and gain new knowledge at the same time. International guests and new friends, warm environment, different people, different ideologies, different topics, different works. All this attracted me in the Aurora Awards. New contacts with new people is always useful for learning and self-knowledge. ""Aurora's"" I am confident that the team made a great job, and the team working on interesting, challenging and sometimes fuzzy, but always a good result, which we have already the second year that we adhere to. It is this team spirit and warm mtnolori I want to volunteer to be a part of this ceremony.
Another factor is the scale of the event. Being part of such a big event always, though a little scary, but it helps to enter into real working process. Mixed situations, solve problems, international guests, and great communication experience. As a volunteer you gain experience, which is very important for me and exciting, as it will help further my career in film.
Aurora Awards is a great opportunity to show my full potential, applying my skills and socialize with new people, and for that I want to become a volunteer for this event.","Dilijan Development project,UWC Dilijan college",,"Social media (Facebook, Twitter)",Loading...,arm,el.nahapetyan@gmail.com,False

","I am a strong believer that humans are inherently good, and that even the smallest kindness is always rewarded. Aurora Humanitarian Initiative is one of the programs that share this worldview and to be part of it would be a truly incredible experience. 

Moreover, I also believe that any event’s success is measured by the team of talented and skillful individuals who work diligently to realize it. I am confident that my previous volunteering experiences and my education background will help me bring value to the Aurora Movement.

I believe that Aurora prize will give me a platform to further develop my communication skills and will enable me to be a part of the discourse on humanitarian activities and the ways to become a philanthropist. Upon entering an important chapter in my life, I believe that this experience will leave its undeniable mark on my future career and life.

It is awarded on behalf of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide. Besides its support and help towards Armenians it also helps other nations. During this year the award was able to help a lot of people from various nations in different ways, for example by sponsoring their charity projects thus realizing it.
Last year I was given a great opportunity to be a volunteer at this world-famous award.  I was lucky enough to be a part of the event team as I gained various skills, which helped me in both my social and everyday life. During 2017 Aurora Prize weekend I made a lot of friends and met well-known people, who inspired me to become a better person. This year is also an irreplaceable chance for me to participate in this amazing event, because I will become more experienced, will learn new things and will communicate with many people, who crossed sees and oceans for getting to my country.

","Tatev Revival project, UWC Dilijan college, St. Gevorg Church Restoration project in Tbilisi, Dilijan Art Initiative","Yes, I am a member of EYP and AEGEE.","Social media (Facebook, Twitter)","Since 2015 I have been actively involved in community work, by taking part in various extracurricular activities. In High School I was a member of Student Council and simultaneously took part in different forums and volunteering activities, such as Nobel Days in Yerevan, EPIC IT Forum, Competitive College Club, ReAnimania International Film Festival and European Youth Parliament. 
The first place, where I participated was an event, called “Nobel Days in Yerevan”, where I was selected as a delegate, during this event I was honored to meet five Nobel Laureates under one roof and listen to the interesting lectures about their findings.
 The other experience I got, while being selected as a delegate at EPIC IT Forum, which helped me to get a lot of interesting information concerning IT sphere. Another step to success was becoming a member at Competitive College Club, where I have been getting exceptional knowledge in various spheres and huge experience at many fields.
 One of the volunteering activities, where I participated was ReAnimania International Film Festival in 2016, during which I learned a lot of things about cinema, animation and got useful information concerning these fields. During this event I met Bill Plympton, who is a famous American animator, graphic designer, cartoonist and filmmaker. He gave a speech about the art of filmography and showed his works to all participants and organization team, consequently I was inspired by both, his speech and works. I also had a chance to talk with him in person and tell the gratitude, which I had towards him. Though I have been interested in cinema since childhood, the volunteering work, which I did for this event inspired and motivated me to major in this field in the future. 
 I also got practical knowledge by working as an intern at ETC English language center, by checking paper-based tests and helping the staff, by printing the necessary materials.
After graduating from high school I did not stop my socially active life, on the contrary, I started to participate in more places. In May 2017 I was selected as a volunteer at Aurora Prize Awakening for Humanity. The official ceremony was on 28th of May. I was there from morning till midnight. That day other volunteers and I helped our coordinators in administrative and organizational questions. During the ceremony I was honored to see many outstanding people, including the famous Armenian Charles Aznavour. It was a great honor for me to meet him and participate in such a big event. 
In October 2017 I was volunteering at Education USA Fair, organized by American Councils. During this event I was helping representatives from American universities and getting useful information about their colleges. Moving on to November 2017, I participated in International Summit, hosted by a non-governmental Armenian organization “United Youth Union” in Dilijan, Armenia. This summit gave me a chance to get useful information about startups and master my public speaking skills by presenting the idea of my team work in front of a large audience. Since October till March I have been an organizer at European Planning Meeting, which took place from March 8-12. During this amazing event around 170 Europeans visited Yerevan and it was considered to be the biggest event in my city for which so many young people joined it.

Volunteering for a humanitarian initiative like this is the best opportunity to feel closer to the people who commit themselves to the well-being of other, forgetting about themselves most of the time. It is a unique chance to meet them, to listen to their stories, to become a better person. 
Thus, Aurora Prize means love, courage, commitment and is the best education to ever imagine.

I myself thing that humanity is the only way to make this world a better place to live. 
Last year, while studying at Eurnekian high school, I had an unbelievable experience of meeting Marguerite Barankitse in Echmiadzin. Her story and her attitude towards what she is doing really inspired me.

","When people ask me  what is your hobby or passion I immediatly answer:volunteering.I feel like I was born to help people and make a change and volunteering is the best way to  do it.Volunteering helps me to feel more confident and appreciated,inspires me to become a better person,gives a chance to meet open-minded people,set a network and be part of the communtiy.It is the best way for me to learn new skills,explore more and be a good example for my community.
So my passion for volunteering is the one,but not the only and the most important  reason I am applying.
The main reason I am applying is the concept of Aurora itself.I strongly believe in the power of Aurora and I am touched by the impact it makes in the world.Aurora made me realize that humanity is still alive ,there are still people who care, who save others risking their own life,people who are ready to invest in our future and make our world a better place to live.And I am especially thankful to Aurora and one of the  founders-Ruben Vardanyan who helped me to find my dream and passion in  life.UWCD college- founded again by him became the reason I am living for and now I am   becoming a better person to deserve to study there.Aurora  inspired me again to become a doctor.I had been dreaming of becoming a doctor since childhood but when I got older, I had a chance to be in hospitals,I was told stories about different people who did not receive mediacal aid because of finances and  I was dissappointed of reality,because I used to think that being a doctor is not a proffession,but a lifestyle.And Aurora showed me that I was right.This is why I have this strong desire to join this community and have my  investment in the movement which changed my life and is changing other lives.","Dilijan Development project, UWC Dilijan college, Dilijan Art Initiative","EYP Armenia,I am the community","Social media (Facebook, Twitter)",,eng,milena.kirakosyan.2002@gmail.com,False

Locals, especially, were unable to understand the idea of the Prize and were considering it as a waste of money.  While, fortunately, I can’t say the same thing for the Aurora Prize 2017, cause the attitude of the people changed a lot and when one day an old local man was trying to explain the main idea of Aurora to me, at that moment I just realized that our one year hard work was productive. I feel even more appreciated, when we were officially qualified as “Ambassadors of Aurora Prize” by Ruben Vardanyan. 
    Deeply believing in the idea of “Aurora Prize”, I see volunteering as a way to have my input in this world humanitarian movement. I had the honor to be in the team since its very start.

The pain and sorrow which my people faced during the eight years of the Armenian Genocide will be forever in our hearts.

The thing is that it wasn't one of the biggest goals in my life to achieve last year and I treated it as one of the common volunteering experiences after which I can get a certificate and 20-30 more people who will like my facebook profile picture. Now, when it is the very last day of applying as a volunteer, I do apply and just paste the motivation letter which I wrote a few months ago :)
I want to be a volunteer during 2018 Aurora Prize weekend because I do understand and appreciate the sense of it and I do consider appreciation as the most valuable things of our lives. Appreciation is the best ""thank you"" to humans. I want to be a volunteer so that I can just feel proud that I was a piece of such amazing ""appreciation"". Being volunteer will give me an opportunity to develop my skills, to enrich my professional and non-professional background, to make my world-outlook wider and to get network for life. Every time I volunteer I recognize people who later become really close to me. As a future linguist and a professional of cross-cultural communication, I appreciate also inter-cultural communication. Aurora is both. I am sure that Aurora Prize will be a platform of non-academical education. I do want Aurora Prize to be one of the greatest things to ever happen in my life!!!","UWC Dilijan college, FAST Foundation","Volunteer at Skill.am

Since I have been in Armenia, I have volunteered for Armenia Tree Project (I worked in the Environmental Education department and helped with research, presentation creation and deliverance, project brainstorming, and project write-ups), the Armenian Center for National and International Studies (doing research and writing), EVN Report (mostly reporting and writing, though I did help also with copy-editing), and I am currently a volunteer in Gyumri at AGATE (giving presentations on various topics to women with disabilities), World Vision (helping with social media and translations), and Shirak State University (doing translations and creating a brochure for international students). I also volunteer my time hosting two English clubs (one for schoolchildren and one for university students) here in Gyumri, and plan to go to volunteer in Artsakh in May. ","I would like to be a volunteer during the 2018 Aurora Prize weekend because I am a committed believer in the Aurora Prize's mission and love the work this award supports. Recently I was speaking with a friend, and he told me about a saying he had recently heard: “There are two types of people. Those who think ‘I don’t want anyone to suffer like I did.’ And those who think, ‘I suffered; why shouldn’t they?’” I believe the Aurora Prize is comprised of individuals who make up the first category of people, and that’s something I absolutely love and want to support. There is so much hurt, hate, and pain surrounding the Armenian Genocide… and I understand where these feelings are coming from. But as an Armenian people, we have allowed this pain and hate to almost consume us... and to a certain extent it is stopping us from moving forward. This award, however, is a way to move forward. It is a way to acknowledge what happened by paying it forward and uplifting others. It recognizes the bravery and strength in moments of darkness and misery. Aurora Prize Co-Founder, Ruben Vardanyan, said: ""We want to honor those who risk their own safety because of a heightened sense of humanity and responsibility and support life-saving causes in a tangible way.” This is a project and mindset that I would love the opportunity to support and be a part of.
